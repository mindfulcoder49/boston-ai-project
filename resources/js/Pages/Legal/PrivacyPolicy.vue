                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the service.

                        <p>
                            We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Service depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>a. Personal Data:</strong>
                            Personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, and password (hashed), that you voluntarily give to us when you register for an account with the Service or choose to participate in various activities related to the Service, such as saving locations or subscribing to our plans. If you register using a third-party social media account (e.g., Google), we will collect personal information that you have made publicly available via your social media account, such as your name, email address, and profile picture.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            When you save locations (e.g., "Home," "Work") or set a central location for map data display, we collect the latitude, longitude, and address you provide for these locations. This information is used to provide you with relevant data and reports for those areas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>c. Derivative Data (Usage Information):</strong>
                            Information our servers automatically collect when you access the Service, such as your IP address, your browser type, your operating system, your access times, and the pages you have viewed directly before and after accessing the Service. We may also collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as features used and AI assistant queries (anonymized or aggregated where possible to improve the service).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>d. Financial Data:</strong>
                            Financial information, such as data related to your payment method (e.g., valid credit card number, card brand, expiration date) that we may collect when you purchase, order, return, exchange, or request information about our services from the Service. We store only very limited, if any, financial information that we collect. Otherwise, all financial information is stored by our payment processor, Stripe, and you are encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact them directly for responses to your questions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>e. Data from Social Networks:</strong>
                            User information from social networking sites, such as Google, including your name, your social network username, location, gender, birth date, email address, profile picture, and public data for contacts, if you connect your account to such social networks.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>f. Mobile Device Data (If Applicable):</strong>
                            Device information such as your mobile device ID number, model, and manufacturer, and information about the location of your device, if you access the Service from a mobile device and have enabled location services.
